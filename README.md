# Spill GTK2/3 theme

This is Spill, a 3 colored, blue accented theme, based on the official Ambiance theme for Ubuntu, with the main goal of being pixel perfect / identical for both GTK versions.



## Why?

I really don't like that there isn't a simple, good looking and coherent GTK theme for both major versions. Even the official Ubuntu theme has distinct widget designs depending on the GTK version. Which is funny, because the GTK3 uses many pixmaps - so it could be made almost identical to the GTK2 version by cropping some screenshots of the widgets...

My goal is to create a theme as coherent as possible.



## Screenshot?

The theme is *so* work in progress that a preview would be pointless. Imagine the default Ubuntu theme, but with blue accents instead of orange, also with some tweaks here and there, like a bit more flattiness.



## Other GTK3 versions?

This is a question I can't answer. I'm totally new to GTK theming, but I heard that GTK developers break existing themes with almost every minor version release - so maintaining a theme for GTK3 is a hell.

My primary goal is to support the upstream Ubuntu version of GTK3, because that is the distro I'm using. I don't have plans to simultaneously support other versions, because I likely won't have enough time - but feel free to contribute to this project! I would appreciate it.
